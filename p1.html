        <p>During my first year in industrial IT I had the opportunity to apply my acquired skills and acquire new ones with a project.</p>
        <p>For the project there were 5 people in my group, we had some constraints, make a game with 2 dice, make a program in C and make an electronic circuit that would communicate with the C program via a communication card.</p>   
        <p>To start with, we came up with a game using 2 dice. The game is called Double Five and the rules were: each player in turn throws the 2 dice, then adds the total of the two dice to the player's total. If the total is 55 or less, the player is saved and can pass the dice on to the next player. If, by bad luck, the total is 55 or more, he's out, and the winner is the other player.</p>   
        <p>After that, we drew up a mind map, a Pert method and a Gantt chart to assign tasks to each person, because there are 2 distinct parts to the project: the electronics part and the programming part.</p>
        <p>For the electronics part, we first had to read and understand the components available to us, then we drew up an ISIS and ARES diagram, and finally wired up the breadboard.</p>
        <p>I had the programming part of the project, before starting the programming I carried out an analysis of the project to know exactly how the code should work, after that I started programming the program and I also had to implement the communication board so that it worked with the code and the breadboard.</p>
        <p>To finish the project, we connected the electronic part to the programming part via the communication board, so that the game ran and the dice were displayed on the breadboard.</p>
        <p>This project enabled me to greatly improve my C programming skills as well as my electronics skills, and I developed collaborative skills as we had to work in groups.</p>
