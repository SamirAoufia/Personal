        <p>During my first year in industrial IT. I had the opportunity to apply my acquired skills and acquire new ones when faced to a project.</p>
        
        <p>Regarding this project, which was composed of a 5 people team, multiple constraints were established, such as creating a game with 2 dices, making a program in C language, to finish building an electronic circuit that would communicate with the C program via a communication card.</p>   
       
        <p>To start, the team came up with a game using 2 dices. The game was called Double Five and the rules were the following ones: each player takes turns rolling both dices, then adds the total of the two dices to the player's total. If the total is less than 55, the player is saved and can give the dices on to the next player. If, by bad luck, the total is 55 or more, he's out, and the winner is the other player.</p>   
        
        <p>After that, we drew up a mind map, a Pert method and a Gantt chart to assign tasks to each person, because there were 2 distinct parts in the project: the electronic part and the programming part.</p>
        
        <p>For the electronic part, we first had to read and understand the components available, then we drew up an ISIS and ARES diagram, and finally wired up the breadboard.</p>
        
        <p>Before I started programming, I carried out an analysis of the project to find out exactly how the code should work. Then I started programming the program and had to set up the communication board to work with the code and the breadboard.</p>
 
        <p>To finish the project, we connected the electronic part to the programming part via the communication board, so that the game ran, and the dices were displayed on the breadboard.</p>
        
        <p>This project enabled me to greatly improve my C programming skills as well as my electronics skills, and I developed collaborative skills as we had to work in groups.</p>
