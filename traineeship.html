        <p>As part of my bachelor's degree in industrial IT, I did a 15 week traineeship at the Smart Gastronomy Lab. </p>
        
        <p>During this traineeship, I had a project to carry out, which involved working on existing embedded systems to enable a wireless connection as well as the display and processing of data on a website.</p>
        
        <p>For the embedded system part, I started by understanding the different systems. </p>
        
        <p>There was a cooking system that recovered various data during cooking. This system was built with an Arduino mega, lcd screen and several sensors. To make it wireless. I used an esp-01S which can collect data in series and send them to a mqtt server then send them to a database using a JavaScript script.</p>
        
        <p>After that, I worked on a tray, able to measure the strength exerted during a meal. This system was built with an esp32 which allows wireless communication easily, the data from esp32 are sent directly sent to a database.</p>
                
        <p>Finally, I set up a Bluetooth communication to retrieve the values. For this I used an esp32 that connects to a raspberry using a python script. This script sends the data to a mqtt server. Then, as the cooking system, a JavaScript script transmits this data to a database.</p>
        
        <p>For the website part, I used Node.js in combination with Next.js as a framework, as well as React to build the user interface. The code was written in TypeScript. For component styling, I used the Shadcn/UI library and recharts.</p>
        
        <p>To enable all this work, I used a local server, a raspberry PI, which allowed me to run a docker with several software packages, such as portainer, mosquitto, influxdb, postgrésql.</p>
