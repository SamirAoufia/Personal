        <p>During my second year in industrial IT, I had a course called multidisciplinary project 2, which grouped together several courses such as english, web development 2, embedded systems and databases. </p>

        <p>To succeed all these courses, we had to complete a project in three weeks, which consisted in identifying different parts of a Lego brick. The project had to consist of at least two parts: an embedded system and a website that included a database.</p>

        <p>My team, which consisted of Theo and myself, we had the colors.</p>
        <p>We had to develop a system that would recognize the different colors of the lego bricks as they moved along a conveyor belt, send them to a database and finally display them on our website.</p>
        <p>We started the project by making a mind map to properly understand what the system needed to work, after which we split the project into 2 parts. Theo was in charge of the website part and I was in charge of the embedded system part.</p>
        <p>For the embedded system, we used an arduino mega 2560, a HUSKYLENS camera, an lcd screen, a button and a conveyor belt.</p>
        <p>The conveyor belt moved Lego bricks so the camera could recognize the color, the camera sent the color to the arduino, which displayed it on the lcd screen and sent it to a database via node-red, and the button was used to erase the data on the lcd screen.</p>
        <p>For the website and database, we used a raspberry PI running node-red and a docker containing our entire project.</p>
        <p>Our website was made in nodejs, which contained several frameworks such as express and twig, as orm we used prisma and for our database MYSQL.</p>
        <p>For communication between the embedded system and the website, we used node-red, a tool for interconnecting several pieces of hardware. the arduino sent the colors to node-red, which in turn sent them to the database. Finally, the site fetched the latest additions to the database and displayed them.</p>
        <p>For the physical part, which you can see in the pictures on your left, we used MakerBeam.</p>
        <p>During this experience, I honed my skills in embedded systems and real-time data processing. Working with Theo strengthened my ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment, solve complex problems and oversee a project from conception to completion. Practical challenges included integration of sensors seamlessly and creating a user-friendly interface.</p>
        <p>Overall, this project strengthened my adaptability and problem-solving skills.</p>
        <p>For this project we used <span class="highlight-text">HTML</span>, <span class="highlight-text">Bootstrap</span>, <span class="highlight-text">JavaScript</span>, <span class="highlight-text">NodeJS</span>, <span class="highlight-text">Twig</span>, <span class="highlight-text">Node-Red</span>, <span class="highlight-text">MySQL</span>, <span class="highlight-text">Docker</span> and <span class="highlight-text">SQL</span></p>
